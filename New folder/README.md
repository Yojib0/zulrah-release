# Ucci external plugins

I do NOT offer support for these plugins. They are for learning purposes only. If the bot gets stuck good luck on fixing it

If you find any bugs and want to submit a PR, i'd be happy to review and merge it.

## Unethical Zulrah

[Directory](/unethical-zulrah/)

It has been customized by me to support banking, it does not death walk. Config for the plugin is pretty barebones as hardcoding the banking is easier and I'm lazy.

It does not support the use of rigour, it should be easily modifyable to do so though.

If ur running the plugin without any edits to the code make sure you have at least these items in your bank:

    Antivenom+ (4)
    Zul-andra teleport
    2x prayer potion
    Range potion
    Magic potion
    2x Ring of recoil
    Karambwan
    Ring of dueling

Start the plugin from ferox enclave, have ur range gear in the inventory.

## Ucci-ZeahRc

[Directory](/ucci-zeahrc/)

This plugin has been tested for a grand total of two entire days before getting me banned. 
Can't say if it's stable or not

Start at the blood rune mine with a chisel and pickaxe.

## Ucci-clockworks

[Directory](/ucci-clockworks/)

Start this plugin with law runes in your inventory and a dust battlestaff equiped.
You should have at least 45 magic for camelot tele and have your house setup right.
The clockwork making part is stable and it can reach to ~1100 clockworks per hour.

Restocking isn't as stable, there's a few issues with the buying process, 
with some fixes it should be able to restock steel bars and run for as long as you have enough law runes.

## Ucci-flaxspinner

[Directory](/ucci-flaxspinner/)

Spins flax in lumbridge

## Ucci-banwatch

[Directory](/ucci-banwatch/)

Sends an discord webhook to a channel if ur accounts gets banned
Only works if you have unethical autologin or w/e installed as it needs to see the banned screen.
Will quit the client after the ban.
